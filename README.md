# employee-tracker
This app will allow employers to track their employees and current tasks on hand.

An employer will be able to add departments, employees, and roles with their corresponding information using inquirer and prompts.

The user will also be able to view the information thanks to integration with mySQL.

I utilized mySQL for this particular homework to manage the database and the information within it.

Everything is done on the back-end for now in the terminal, but I plan on making a front-end appearance for this app so that employers can utilize it.
